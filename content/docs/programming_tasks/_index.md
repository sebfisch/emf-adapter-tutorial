# Apply what you learned

You are now ready to deepen your understanding of what you learned in this tutorial by completing three tasks.
Each task can be started based on a specific version of the code.
Subsequent tasks build on the code from previous tasks, so I recommend completing the tasks in order.
Of course, you can also skip a task and start from a version of the code that contains its solution.

If you don't want to write code yourself, you can still inspect the solutions.
Each task mentions a link to changes in the git repository that complete it.

Start with the first tasks about using the discussed base class for [typed adapters].

[typed adapters]: typed_adapters
